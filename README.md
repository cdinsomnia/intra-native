We are a team of 42 Berlin Students which want to upgrade our portfolio. So we started with our project with the temporary title "Intra Native".<br><br>Intra Native is an App Version of the Intra from the 42 schools and adds some productivity features like<br>notifications before an event, or get notified about an evaluation. You will mainly see what you subscripted to to act as an productive unit to make your life easier at 42.<br><br>We just started development so if you want to look what our journey is, just visit our Trello Board.<br>https://trello.com/b/oPY1NS2G/intra-native-feature-plan
